2. Create virtual environment
3. Install libraries dependencies in virtual environment
4. Run the StaycationX repository
5. Populate the database with data
6. View the MongoDB database via MongoDB Compass

## Task 1: Clone the StaycationX repository

1. Open Terminal.

2. Clone the StaycationX repository into your user home folder.

   ```bash

   git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/staycationX
   ```

## Task 2: Create virtual environment

1. Navigate the staycationX folder.

   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/staycationX
   ```

2. Create virtual environment.

   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate virtual environment.

   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

## Task 3: Install libraries dependencies in virtual environment

1. Use pip to install the libraries listed in `requirements.txt` file.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Task 4: Run the StaycationX repository

1. Run `start.sh` file in the folder to start the StaycationX app.

   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

2. Open web browser and visit `http://localhost:5000`. You should see the StaycationX website.

## Task 5: Populate data in the database

### Step 1: Register an admin user

### Step 2: Populate the database with data

You will need to upload 3 CSV files. They are `booking.csv`, `users.csv` and `staycation.csv`.

The 3 CSV files can be found in StaycationX > app > assets > js folder.

## Login Credentials

Students are <font color="red"><u>**strongly advised**</u></font> to change their password upon the first login to prevent unauthorized access to their machine.

**Virtual Machine Login Details** <br>
<u>Azure Lab Services (Ubuntu-22.04)</u><br>
username: ubuntu <br>
password: ICT381ubuntu

Users can use the command `passwd` to change their password.

## Quota System

* Students will be assigned 20 hours per week for the first 6 weeks, followed by 30 hours per week for the remainder of the course. These hours will cover class sessions, virtual labs, independent practice and assignments.

* Quotas will be replenished progressively every Monday at 6pm.

* Unused hours will be forfeited at the end of each week.

* **Illustration**:
    * In Week 2, if student A uses 5 out of 20 hours. The remaining 15 hours will be forfeited. In Week 3, 20 hours will be added to the 5 hours used in Week 2, giving the student a total quota of 25 hours.

* Shutting down the Ubuntu virtual machine does not stop the user quota hours.
    * Students are reminded to turn off the virtual machine from the Azure page in Canvas to avoid continuing to incur user quotas.

* The virtual machine will be automatically shutdown once the user quotas are exhausted.

* For additional quota hours due to genuine needs (eg. extra practice/assignment):
    * Please send a request to your instructor, including the reasons and copy VLI team (vlisupport@suss.edu.sg). Requests will reviewed on a case-by-case basis and additional hours will be granted if approved.

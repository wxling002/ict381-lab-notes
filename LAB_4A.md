## Task 3: Accessing EC2 based on different platforms

Before you can access your EC2 instance, you will need to be able to:
1. Get information about your EC2 instance. 
    - Take note of the **IP address** of the EC2 instance which you will need to connect to the instance.

    ![](images/lab4A/ec2-instance-ip.png)
2. Locate your AWS EC2 private key pair.
    - Go to your Canvas page and click on **AWS Details**
